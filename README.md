# Weakly-supervised convolutional neural networks for multimodal image registration

## Introduction
This is a tutorial aiming to use short narratives and self-explantory code to explain the implementation of the deep-learning-based image registration method in [Hu et al 2018][Hu2018a] (and the preliminary work was published in [Hu et al ISBI2018][Hu2018b]).
